# MyReads Project

This is my Reads Project a part of the program  Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of React and to put into practice
everything we have learned throughout the first course.

This project mainly consist of a webapp that has list page showing the books I am currently reading, read or want to read (these are the 3 bookshelves to be shown as well.)
It also has a search page, toa dd more books to my library and set the state of each book I am currenltys earching, and if the book is already on my library it shows on what shelf it is.

#Installation
To get started to review and/or run the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Backend Server

The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods  to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
