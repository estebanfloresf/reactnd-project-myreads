# MyReads Project

This is my Reads Project a part of the program  Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of React and to put into practice
everything we have learned throughout the first course.

This project mainly consists of a web app that has list page showing the books I am currently reading, read or want to read (these are the 3 bookshelves to be shown as well.)
It also has a search page, to add more books to my library and set the state of each book I am currently searching, and if the book is already in my library it shows on what shelf it is.
